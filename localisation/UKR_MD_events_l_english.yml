  ### NEW GENERALS ###
  ukraine_news.4.t: "Changing of Guard in the SVU"
  ukraine_news.4.d: "As our faithful High Military Command have served their country for many years, the time has come to pass the baton to their younger and more skillful compatriats. Some will continue to serve the High Command in an advisor setting, but for others, it is a time to retire from service altogether after a long period of serving the country. May our new generals continue to defend our borders."
